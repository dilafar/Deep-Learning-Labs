1. explain how 1D convolution can be used to identify the edges in an image?
	throghh the filter the edges are detected , there can be number of filters can be created to detect each fetchers and edges.	
             
2.Why does the validation error increases when the number of epochs are increased?
	i) it can be due to the small dataset, the model may struggle to generalize effectively, and increasing the number of epochs can make it overfit.
	ii) to overcome this we can Use a simpler model architecture with fewer layers or neurons to reduce overfitting , use different learning rates and Apply regularization techniques 	    like L1 or L2 regularization or dropout layers.

3.Explain how the mini batch SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) algorithm can converge faster than the batch Gradient Descent algorithm?

	Mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a method for training machine learning models that strikes a balance between computational efficiency and convergence speed. Unlike 	batch Gradient Descent, which uses the entire training dataset in each iteration, mini-batch SGD divides the data into mini-batches. By updating the model more frequently with these 	mini-batches.
