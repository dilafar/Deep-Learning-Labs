1.What happens when the number of hidden nodes increase?

	The accuracy was increased and the cost per iteration was decreased.

2.Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase? 

	When increasing the first several nodes accuracy increased and hit and highest accuracy and after that when nodes increased accuracy 	will reduced and maintain a constant accuracy 	and at some point the accuracy will be reduced and increased.
